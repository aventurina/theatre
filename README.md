This is a simple JavaScript-based system to handle ticket purchases for the Magical Mystery Theatre guests. The ticket price depends on the age of the guest and the show time. Here are the rules:

The general admission ticket price is $20. If the guest is 12 and under or 65 and older, they qualify for a discounted ticket price of $10. If the guest is attending a matinee show, they get an additional $3 off any ticket price.

Uses HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and Javascript.
